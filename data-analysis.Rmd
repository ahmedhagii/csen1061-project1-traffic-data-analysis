## Data Processing

We'll load the data and take a look around its different columns and a sample of records.
```{r}
data.raw <- read.csv('traffic-data.csv')
data.raw %>% glimpse
```

we have many features concerning the ads, let's see how many unique ad logos we got, just to make sure the ad features are not relevant to our investigation.

```{r}
data.raw %>% select(ad.logo) %>% unique() %>% length()
```

since there's only one unique logo, then the ad is the same across all the rerports we got. Let's remove all features prefixed with "ad"

```{r}
data.reports <- data.raw %>% select(-(starts_with("ad")))
```
